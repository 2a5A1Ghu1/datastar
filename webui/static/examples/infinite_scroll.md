## Infinite Scroll

[Original HTMX Version](https://htmx.org/examples/infinite-scroll/)

## Explanation
TODO

The infinite scroll pattern provides a way to load content dynamically on user scrolling action.

Letâ€™s focus on the final row (or the last element of your content):
```html
<tr hx-get="/contacts/?page=2"
    hx-trigger="revealed"
    hx-swap="afterend">
  <td>Agent Smith</td>
  <td>void29@null.org</td>
  <td>55F49448C0</td>
</tr>
```

This last element contains a listener which, when scrolled into view, will trigger a request. The result is then appended after it. The last element of the results will itself contain the listener to load the next page of results, and so on.

`revealed` - triggered when an element is scrolled into the viewport (also useful for lazy-loading). If you are using overflow in css like overflow-y: scroll you should use intersect once instead of revealed.


## Demo
<div
    id="infinite_scroll"
    data-fetch-url="'/examples/infinite_scroll/data'"
    data-on-load="$$get"
