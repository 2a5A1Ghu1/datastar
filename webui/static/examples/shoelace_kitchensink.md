## Explanation
[Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) is a wonderful webcomponent library. It is a great fit for Datastar, because it is designed to be used with plain HTML.  All the Datastar built-in plugins just work with Shoelace.

Note this is using a `nested` data store just to verify that works.  The store gets sent will get sent to the server as the whole context of the client should be available to the server.
