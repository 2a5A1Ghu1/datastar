<input data-focus value="Kamehameha"/>
```

This plugin allows you to focus an element.  It will focus the element when the value is true and blur it when the value is false.  This is useful for focusing an input when a modal is opened especially when you changed elements in the backend and need to focus the input after merging the changes.
