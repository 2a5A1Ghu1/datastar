# Visibility

![Events](/static/images/invisible.webp)

```html
<div data-show="$count > 5">I'm a big number</div>
```

Simple expression that should be at least [truthy](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/recap/truthy).  The element will exists, just effects the display styling.

## Future Plans

* Make it use modifiers for transition effects such as fade, slide, etc.
