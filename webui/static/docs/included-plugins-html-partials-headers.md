# Headers

![ref](/static/images/headers.gif)


```html
<div data-header-authorization="`Bearer: ${$myClientSideToken}`"/>
```

This plugin allows you to set headers on a request.  It will set the header when the value is true and remove it when the value is false.  This is useful for setting an authorization header when a user is logged in or some custom header when you need to send some extra information to the server.
