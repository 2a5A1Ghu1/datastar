# Haikus

[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) has a wonderful haiku in its footer

> Javascript fatigue

> longing for a hypertext

> already in hand

I think this also applies to Datastar, but thought of a few that might match more to this project's goals.

> Hypermedia

> reactivity advanced

> attributes enhance

--

> Code compiles with ease,

> Build steps streamline, bring release,

> Dev's joy, future peace.

--

> Standard tags convey,

> No monkey patching today,

> Clean hypertext, hooray!
